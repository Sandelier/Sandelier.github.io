        <p>I started to make LangWatch2 because my friend and I typically watch movies, animes, or videos together. We began discussing Digimon Adventures, which we used to watch when we were children. My friend suggested that I develop a program that would allow us to watch animes in different languages. This way, I could watch them in Finnish while my friend watches them in Greek. The most challenging aspect I encountered with this program was definitely the limitation of my PC's computational power for encoding videos and setting up the server structure to deliver videos and serve them according to commands, such as different timespans. I was initially thinking of creating the client GUI in Windows Forms because I had never tried it before, and I had learned a little bit of C# in that month. However, I soon realized that I couldn't get this to look correct at all in Windows Forms, which is why I just threw my white flag up and went with the Neutralino library. This project has taught me quite useful stuff already. Before this, I didn't know anything about encoding or any of that stuff about videos or streaming videos to users.</p>
