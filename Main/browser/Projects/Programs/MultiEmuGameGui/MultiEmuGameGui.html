        <p>I was starting to get a little bit annoyed by constantly having to think of what emulator to use, so I just made this so that I could have all the games on a single page where I could just press "Play" and it would start up the correct emulator and the game. Also, I wanted to be able to easily compress the games that I do not play currently to save disk space.</p>
