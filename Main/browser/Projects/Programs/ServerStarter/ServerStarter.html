        <p>I wanted to make a program that I can just keep running on my PC that allows my friends to start up game servers without me having to always open them. For example, if I were away or sleeping, my friends could still start up the server without having to wait for me to come home. This had a couple issues with, for example, Terraria because, for some reason, the server was not coded to understand stdins or signterms, which made communicating through the ServerStarter and Terraria servers impossible. In the end, I did solve it by making sure that the Terraria server opens an HTTP server that ServerStarter then communicates with.</p>
