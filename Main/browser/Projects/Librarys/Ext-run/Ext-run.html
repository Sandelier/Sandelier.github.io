            Ext-run was first named Web-Forge but later on i decided that i like Ext-run more then Web-Forge. 
            I started making ext-run right after MangaPresence project because i wanted to quickly test extensions on different browsers without a need for multiple different programs with auto reloading. 
            The hard part was that i could have used like spawn to launch browsers immediately without specifying locations myself in the code but that brings the issue of not being able to stop the process or know if it launched. 
            But what will most likely be the hardest part is making it work on firefox because firefox dosent have arguments to launch extensions instead i need to somehow edit the user profile to make it work which will require some thinking since i havent yet checked how the user folder works on firefox.
