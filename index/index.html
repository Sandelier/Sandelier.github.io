						<h2>Coding</h2>

						<p>At present, my primary coding language is <b>Javascript/Node.js</b>.</p>
						<p>I do know some <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b> also.</p>
						<p>I license all my projects with MIT License since i like to share my code and allow other people to modify and benefit from it.</p>

						<h3>Back story</h3>

						<p>My interest in coding started during junior high school while creating Minecraft scripts using the Script plugin in 2017.</p>
						<p>After a hiatus of about year or two, I delved into actual coding.</p>
						<p>I began with <b>Java</b> and i used it for around two months before transitioning briefly to <b>Python</b>. Finally i found <b>Javascript/Node.js</b> which became my primary language.</p>

						<h2>3D</h2>

						<p>Currently my main 3D software is <b>Blender</b>. I do have some familiarity with <b>Fusion 360</b> as well.</p>
						<p>Similar to coding, i believe in sharing, so all my 3D creations are shared with CC BY 4.0.</p>

						<h3>Backstory</h3>
						
						<p>My journey to 3D began in July 2023 when i attended a two-week coure that introduced me to <b>Blender</b>.</p>
						<p>Back then it was just curiosity. However, in August 2023 during a five-month 3D course, my curiosity changed into passion for <b>Blender</b>.</p>
						<p>During the same course, i also learned to use <b>Fusion 360</b></p>
						<p>I enjoy creating mostly cute or horror-themed stuff in Blender, but my knowledge expands beyond just those genres.</p>
