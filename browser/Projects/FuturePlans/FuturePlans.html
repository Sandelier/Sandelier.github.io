                            <h1>Multi langauge watch together</h1>
                            <span>Some kind of an program/website that shows two different language videos so one of you can watch english and other can watch in example greek version.
                                It could be that it like strips the audio from different languages and then just plays whatever language you put on.
                                It should be that you can setup an offset for the audio if the audio is wrongly synced.
                                Then it should send an timespan because of the ping might affect the others timespan.
                                It should either send the video at the start to the other user or it will send it in chunks whichever is best.
                                Maybe it could be that server is on nodejs and maybe like java or some shit as the client version. Check if there is good librarys to make user programs in nodejs (not electron because too much overhead).
                                Maybe make it so on the cleint version at the start the client has to put an ip where to connect to.
