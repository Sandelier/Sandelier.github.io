        <p>Well, the TLDR for why I made this website is simply because I wanted to. There isn't really any significant reason behind it; instead, I wanted to challenge myself and create this website as a sort of story of my projects. I don't expect a lot of people to even look at this website, but the most important thing for me with this website is to challenge myself and make it look the way I want it to. I've already learned so many things from this website that I can't even list them all. My goal is to make all the project websites as different as possible from each other, and none of them should adhere to a typical website design style.</p>
