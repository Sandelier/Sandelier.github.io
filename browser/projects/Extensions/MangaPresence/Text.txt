What is MangaPresence
MangaPresence is a browser extension that, with a node.js server, updates your Discord rich presence based on the manga or anime you're currently reading/watching.

                  
Icon meaning
The icon is basically m + p combining Manga and Presence. The space background was created from the "presence" from rpc because when i thought of presence i was thinking of something that was all around us which reminded me of space

Why
I made this because i mainly like knowing what others are reading and watching and well there were no programs that would achieve the showing of manga and anime pages you are currently in.

Learned
This project was actually my first ever browser extension i ever made and also this is my first time using windows tray to show the program.

Challenges
There were some challenges that i had to figure out like in example how to get correct data from as many websites as possible without knowing the website and actually making it so other people can use it 

Main thing
The main thing i wanted to focus on was that it would be ready right from the box other then getting the client id for your discord bot. And I wanted to make it so after you have set your client id the program would always work without any need for user interaction.
