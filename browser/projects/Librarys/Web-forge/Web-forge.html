                            <span>Web-forge is a command-line tool designed to launch multiple browsers with temporary extensions with automatic reloading. This tool is built to work with npm and is compatible with Chrome, Edge and Brave but there will be more browsers later on.</span>

                            <span>I made this because while i was making the MangaPresence program i started to get little bit annoyed by having to always manually update the changes in extension and i wanted to always have an clean browser.</span>

                            <span>There were some challenges that i had to figure out like in example how could i launch browsers since you cant use like start chrome in example because you cant detect the on close event from it.</span>
