Plan:
    Initial page
        - And make it so that at the center theres like an button to open the website and it has an animation of like pulsing first and then the last pulse would change the opacity of the intialpage.

    Browser projects
        - Mangapresence could have two pages so the landing page would have clean text of the book version and then another page would be the book version.

    Mangapresence  
        - Maybe at x window size the pages will combine because currently if you make it too small like phone size then the text is pretty much unreadable.

    Sources:
        - Removing the header and making some other way of switching between the contents since currently theres two headers on top of eachother which looks bad.

    All:
        - Lot of functions could be made in a more readable way. 
        - I feel like the folder structure is little bit of an mess right now.
